        "Hebrew School": "No – Friendship Circle's mission is social and life-skills support for children/teens with special needs, not academic religious instruction. It complements participants' Jewish education by ensuring inclusion in community life, but does not teach Hebrew or run formal classes",
        "Bar/Bat Mitzvah Preparation": "Yes – in a modified way. While not a standard prep program, Friendship Circle offers a unique Bar/Bat Mitzvah club (\"Teen Boy\" and \"Bat Mitzvah\" groups) that helps special-needs youth prepare for and celebrate Bar/Bat Mitzvah in an accessible way (often a group ceremony or tailored one-on-one preparation with volunteers)",
        "Adult Education": "No – it directly serves youth. However, it does guide parents via support workshops occasionally (e.g., parent support groups, informational sessions on inclusion), but these are not formal adult ed classes in Judaism",
        "Youth Groups": "Yes – Friendship Circle itself functions as a youth group model: teenage volunteers (\"Friends at Home\") are paired with children for weekly playdates and the program holds group youth events (Sunday Circle gatherings, winter camps, field trips) where the children with special needs and teen buddies socialize together as a group",
        "Family and Intergenerational Learning": "Yes – the program heavily involves families: parents network with each other at events, siblings are often included in family outings, and the entire community (across generations) is invited to programs like inclusive holiday celebrations and the annual Friendship Walk. It fosters intergenerational empathy as well, as adult supporters and donors often join the teens and kids at major events",
        "Online/Hybrid Classes": "Yes – especially recently, they've offered virtual meet-ups (Zoom music therapy sessions, online story time) to keep participants engaged when in-person meetups are difficult. They maintain social media groups for parents and volunteers to share resources online as well",
        "Special/Seasonal Programming": "Yes – core events include seasonal holiday parties designed for special needs participation (e.g., a low-sensory Purim carnival, adaptive Chanukah party), the annual end-of-summer overnight retreat, and \"Camp Unity\" summer and winter camps that provide a typical camp experience tailored for children with special needs. The Friendship Circle also holds the prominent annual Friendship Walk fundraiser that doubles as a community festival advocating inclusion",
        "Age Groups Served": "Children and Teens with special needs (typically ages 4 through 21 for participants), and Teenage Volunteers (generally ages 13–18) who serve as buddies. By extension, it also supports the parents and families of those children"

        "Online/Hybrid Classes": "Yes – PJ Library offers many digital resources: an online parent community, virtual storytimes (especially expanded during COVID), music videos, and craft webinars. The Los Angeles PJ Library sends e-newsletters with activity ideas and has social media for sharing content among parents",
        "Special/Seasonal Programming": "Yes – PJ Library in LA partners on seasonal events such as community Hanukkah celebrations, summer park playdates, PJ Library tot Shabbat in the Park series, and 'PJ Goes to Camp' days introducing families to Jewish summer camps.
